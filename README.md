This project serves the purpose of ribosome profiling. The code provided in this repository will transform raw SRR files into mapped sequences
that can be used for gene ontology analysis, with several built in quality control steps. Additionally, serveral R-scripts are provided for
graphs that allowing analysis.

In addition to the code, I provide a step-by-step tutorial, which expains the order of the scripts, and a file containing all the links and ascention
numbers for the files that were used in the project the code was creatted for.
