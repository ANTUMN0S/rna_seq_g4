Step by step instructions for how to run the different scripts.
Don't forget to change the directories within the scripts to suit your working environment.
R-Scripts were run on a local machine, so don't forget to transfer the files needed beforehand.

1. Run sra_prefetch.slurm to fetch the .sra-files of the samples of interest

2. Run fastq_dump.slurm to convert the .sra-files to .fastq-files

3. Run renamer.sh to rename the .fastq-files to names that make them easier to identify

4. Run fastqc1.slurm to perform quality control

5. Download all the files listed in where_to_get_files.txt

6. Run concatenator.sh to concatenate the three fasta-file for the undesired rna (note that they might be in different file formats and need to be changed

7. Run rna_indexing.slurm to prepare the indices for the undesired rna

8. Run genome_indexing.slurm to prepare the indices for the genome

9. Run cutadapt.slurm to clip and trim the polysome files

10. Run fastqc2.slurm to check how the dataquality changed

11. Run map_undesired.slurm to map the reads of the undesired RNA the polysome files (this discards everything that did map)

12. Run map_genome.slurm to map the files from the previous step to the genome

13. Run sorter.slurm to convert the SAM files to sorted BAM files

14. Run 2bit.slurm to convert the genome FASTA file to a 2bit file

15. Run RiboseQC.R for quality control

16. Run countTable.slurm to generate a raw read counts table for each gene and sample

17. Run biotype.slurm to create a table containing all the biotypes

18. Run biotype.R to create the RPF_biotypes.pdf file

19. Run volcano.R to perform differential expression analysis

20. Run gene_ontology.R to perform gene ontology analysis and determine the biological relevance of differentially expressed genes
